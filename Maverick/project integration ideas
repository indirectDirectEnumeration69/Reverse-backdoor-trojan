Maybe i will introduce the hash project for better encryption and less readability ?

integrate into botnet project once botnet and client has been refactored , make shellcode act as a reverse backdoor instead of direct comms with server.

or have both reverse shell functionality within the server set up for the client malware acting as a structured botnet for each client having there own server to communicate to acting as a local command server for local user network devices through router infection? , acting as a detachment of the botnet army - set region for each local network command center - have region organisation .

--each command centre talks to the main botnet through relays .

--introduce public and priv keys through hash algorithm for secure communication using my own has algorithm.
-hmm ....

--need diagram and function diagram for each call purpose .
